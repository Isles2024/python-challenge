General comments:
I was to write most of the code utalizing class resources like the activity files and the class slides, however there were some functions I needed to look up online in order for my code to run properly. These functions are listed below:

Seek(0) - to reset the csv file
.2f - to have my results only print two decmil places
textfile.write('Insert output\n') - to export my results as a text file
.items - to return a view object which contains the key-value pairs of a dictionary
